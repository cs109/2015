This was the first iteration of this class. A lot of excitement about this course

The three modules are:

*1. Prediction and elections:* how did Nate Silver predict 50 out of 50 states correctly in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, and 49 out of 50 correctly in the 2008 election? How much of that was luck? We will discuss how to find, process, combine, visualize, simulate, and summarize election-related data and questions, especially if there are conflicting polls with different reliabilities.

*2. Recommendation and business analytics*: the Neflix Prize was a famous recent example of collaborative filtering: given information about which movies various users have liked and disliked, how should Netflix make recommendations for what movies a user should watch? Many other companies are interested in closely-related problems. Often there is a very large but very sparse data set (e.g., there could be millions of users and tens of thousands of movies, but very few users rate more than a few hundred movies). We will explore techniques for working with such data.

*3. Clustering and text analysis:* Finding structure in  unlabeled data is an important aspect of data science. We will talk about methods for various types of data, including text document analysis via topic modeling. Topic modeling answers questions like: Which topics does a specific document talk about? Which tags would be appropriate for this image according to its description? What is the most important topic of our customers twitter feeds?
