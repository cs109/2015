Learning from data in order to gain useful predictions and insights. This second iteration of the course continues to use methods for five key facets of an investigation: data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; data management to be able to access big data quickly and reliably; exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition; prediction based on statistical methods such as regression and classification; and communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.

Python was used for all programming assignments and projects. All [lectures are be posted here](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html).
